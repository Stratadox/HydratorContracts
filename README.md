The Hydrator package exists in the context of object deserialization. 
It is useful when loading objects from a data source.

To hydrate an object means to assign values to its properties.
A Hydrator populates the fields of other objects.

Hydration often works in tandem with Instantiation; the process of creating empty objects.

For more information, see the recommended [Hydrator implementation](https://github.com/Stratadox/Hydrator).
